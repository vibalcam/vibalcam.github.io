<!-- This work addresses the limitations of traditional techniques in analyzing systemic risk by proposing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for systemic risk analysis in financial networks. Leveraging network structure and feature information, GNNs outperform traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods in classifying entities based on systemic risk importance. Additionally, we introduce C2R, an approach that reduces pre-labeling effort for costly systemic risk metrics by pre-labeling into a small number of classes while predicting continuous risk scores. -->
We propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for systemic risk analysis in financial networks, leveraging network structure to overcome ML limitations. Additionally, we introduce *C2R* approach to reduce pre-labeling efforts for costly continuous systemic risk metrics, enabling modeling these metrics (e.g., quantiles) using data labeled into just a few classes.
