<!-- todo!! add description -->
<!-- The paper proposes using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze systemic risk in financial systems by leveraging the network structure and feature information of financial entities. Additionally, it introduces the C2R (Classify to Regress) approach, which reduces pre-labeling efforts by pre-labeling entities into a small number of classes while still predicting continuous risk scores, enhancing prediction accuracy and efficiency. -->
<!-- This work addresses the limitations of traditional techniques in analyzing systemic risk by proposing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for systemic risk analysis in financial networks. Leveraging network structure and feature information, GNNs outperform traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods in classifying entities based on systemic risk importance. Additionally, we introduce C2R, an approach that reduces pre-labeling effort for costly systemic risk metrics by pre-labeling into a small number of classes while predicting continuous risk scores. -->
