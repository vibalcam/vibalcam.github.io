<!-- The paper proposes using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze systemic risk in financial systems by leveraging the network structure and feature information of financial entities. Additionally, it introduces the C2R (Classify to Regress) approach, which reduces pre-labeling efforts by pre-labeling entities into a small number of classes while still predicting continuous risk scores, enhancing prediction accuracy and efficiency. -->
