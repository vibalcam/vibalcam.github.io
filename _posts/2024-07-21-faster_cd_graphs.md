<!-- todo!! add description -->
<!-- novel combinatorial approximation algorithm for the cluster deletion problem, achieving a more scalable and faster algorithm -->
We provide improved deterministic approximation algorithms and guarantees for Cluster Deletion, and the first combinatorial algorithm for the Strong Triadic Closure (STC) relaxation.
