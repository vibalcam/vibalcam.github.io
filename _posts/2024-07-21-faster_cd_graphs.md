<!-- Vienna, Austria -->
We provide improved deterministic approximation algorithms and guarantees for [*Cluster Deletion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_graph), and the first combinatorial algorithm for the [*Strong Triadic Closure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadic_closure#Strong_Triadic_Closure_Property_and_local_bridges) (STC) relaxation, enabling us to handle graphs with millions of nodes and edges on a standard 16GB laptop.
<!-- We tackle the Cluster Deletion problem in graph theory. This problem involves removing the minimum number of edges to split a graph into fully connected subgraphs (cliques). We provide a simpler and faster deterministic algorithm, along with improved approximation guarantees. We also introduce the first combinatorial algorithm for the Strong Triadic Closure (STC) LP relaxation, enabling us to handle graphs with millions of nodes and edges on a standard 16GB laptop. -->
